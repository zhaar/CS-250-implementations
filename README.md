CS-250 Algorithm implementation
===============================

This repo collect the implementation of most (if not all) algorithms seen in course of
algorithms of EPFL (CS-250).

Every algorithms has two variant: A stateful one that is most likely a copy/paste from the course's slides. And a stateless one using features from functional programming to achieve the achieve the same goal using a similar running time.

Scala has been the language of choice here because it has many necessary functional features
like pattern matching, lazy evaluation, call by name, persistent data structures and for-comprehensions.
And Scala can also express stateful algorithms using a simple and familiar syntax.
