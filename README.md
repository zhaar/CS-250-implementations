CS-250 Algorithm implementation
===============================

This repo collect the implementation of most (if not all) algorithms seen in course of
algorithms of EPFL (CS-250).

The original goal was to provide implementation in two variants: A stateful one that resembles closesly to the pseudocode seen in slides. And a stateless one using features from functional programming to achieve similar running time.

In order to do that, the project started out with scala as the language of choice because of it's ability to describe stateful object-oriented code and purely functional and immutable data structures.

Since then, everyone is encouraged to contribute to any algorithm in the language of their choice, starting with Swift.
